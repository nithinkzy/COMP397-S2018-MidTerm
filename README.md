Instructions :
(5 Marks: GUI, 13 Marks: Functionality, 4 Marks: Internal Documentation, 4 Marks: Revision
Control, 4 Marks: Cloud Services)
1. Download the CreateJS Project Template from eCentennial. Use this code as a starting point for
your Mid-Term Test Project (2 Marks: Functionality).
2. Add a Roll Button control to your GUI that allows the user to generate a random die result each
